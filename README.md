 It's time to actually make a simple command line game.

 1. The computer will think of 3 digit number that has no repeating digits.
 2. You will then guess a 3 digit number
 3. The computer will then give back clues, the possible clues are:

     Close: You've guessed a correct number but in the wrong position
     Match: You've guessed a correct number in the correct position
     Nope: You haven't guess any of the numbers correctly
